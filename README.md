In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I answered some interesting questions about the database. As part of my project I run SQL queries and built some visualizations to present the output of my queries.

Project contains 5 files:

Project_1_presentation.pdf -  includes set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.

question1.sql - SQL code written to answer Question 1
question2.sql - SQL code written to answer Question 2
question3.sql - SQL code written to answer Question 3
question4.sql - SQL code written to answer Question 4

The project was created using PostgreSQL.
